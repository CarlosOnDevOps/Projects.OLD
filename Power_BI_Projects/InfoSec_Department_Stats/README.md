### Summary:
> As the lead Data Analyst for the Information Security department, I identified key performance indicators (KPI) that allowed us to strategize improvements in our data 
> pipelines and workflows. After presenting these findings to Directors and supervisors, our department was able to increase output in several areas, including faster 
> service level agreement (SLA) times and increased documentation of solutions.Utilizing data ETL, I created executive overviews, ticket breakdowns, and security 
> analysts stats reports to provide insights on the following:

### Data Insights:
- *Total tickets and total hours billed*
- *Top companies generating revenue and ticket volume*
- *Distribution of ticket tyupes and subtypes*
- *Monthly breakdown of hours billed per ticket type*
- *Ticket volume and hours billed per Security Analyst*
- *Matrix displaying ticket volume and type per Security Analyst on a monthly basis, including individual ticket IDs*

### Upon completion of this project, I am now more comfortable:
- Cleaning data 
- Creating Power BI measures
